## Description
Dog City is a react web app for dog lovers who wish to learn more about dog breeds. It allows users to browse 172 dog breeds and view their characteristics and images. I was motivated to create Dog City to challenge myself in creating my first fully-functional React app using various API calls. I love dogs (who doesn't!), and I had prospective dog owners in mind when creating Dog City. This app is meant to be used for people who are considering to purchase a new pup, and wish to know more about their desired breed's characteristics.
